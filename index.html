							<p>Just this year, a new study suggested that most Americans are overpaying for electricity by a whopping $27.6 billion dollars per year.</p>
							<p>
								It's very apparent that we as Americans have an energy crisis—a lack of energy from lawmakers and the Public Utility Commission about fixing the crooked business of
								selling overpriced electricity to consumers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Both sides are giving each other cover to do nothing. Just this year, the Public Utility Commission sent lawmakers a report about the glorious, incredible, fantastic
								electricity shopping system it regulates. A problem? Not on their watch.
							</p>
							<p>Lawmakers who get that report from the state regulators can say, <em>"Everything is fine. We don't need to make changes."</em></p>
							<center>
								<img decoding="async" data-src="images/2.jpg" class="img-responsive ls-is-cached lazyloaded" alt="main" src="./img/2.jpg" />
							</center>
							<p>
								Lawmakers refuse to introduce an electricity bill that is designed to end the deceptive marketing practices that power companies use to reap massive profits every year.
							</p>
							<p>
								The system remains a horror show of confusion, duplicity, and unnecessary complications. There's no reason why electricity companies should get the better of regulators
								and consumers, but they do it time and again.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you look at descriptions of more than 300 electricity plans from 55 companies, you see a jumble of garbage language, terms, conditions, and small print—your eyes
								bulge. <a href="javascript:;" class="ctaLink">And you won't learn your exact price until the bill arrives.</a>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Why does this matter? This duplicity leads to you paying more.</strong></p>
